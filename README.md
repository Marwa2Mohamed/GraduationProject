# Project Name:
Predictive Automated Interface Application (PAIA).

# IDEA:
It is an android application which it's mainly built and used to take advantage of Artificial intelligence to change the way a user uses his/her mobile phone (improve the user experience for mobile usage). That happens by predicting the repeated and daily actions that the user does continuously at the same time and day (other parameters can be used such as Location), then the application changes/updates the home screen interface/widget with the actions predicted at the same day and time.
So, our concern about the application is to develop the user experience for smartphones and their home screen interface. As an example, and this was the first feature which we had worked on is the user Call Logs. John calls Adam, Christin and two other people from 9:00 to 11:00 on Saturday, within those two hours, these four contacts will appear on the home screen widget waiting for Ahmed to click on the name that he wants to call. Then from 12:00 to 14:00, those four will be changed to another four that the application had predicted that he would call. Other features had thought about as a future work such as predicting his/her waking up time for work or school and set the alarm for him/her automatically. Similar to the call logs feature is the most used applications at specific periods such as uber and email, in addition to many other features.
